  ### Ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and puffed snacks
</div>


{% capture text %}
This research stream is focused on improving ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereals and puffed snacks, aiming to make them healthier, more sustainable, and of higher quality. We are working to increase the fiber and protein content of these snacks, turning them into nutritious options that still taste great. To achieve this, we are exploring innovative processing techniques (e.g., gas-assisted extrusion cooking) that not only enhance nutritional value but also improve texture, a key aspect linked to the microstructure of the final product.
In our lab, we employ high-speed thermal imaging and X-ray imaging techniques to gain deeper insights into the expansion process during production and to analyze the structure of the products post-production. The high-speed thermal imaging enables visualizing how the food products puff and change on the surface, so that we can refine the production process to create food products that are both appealing and nutritious. The X-ray imaging techniques allow us to see and quantify the microstructural characteristics of the food products in detail and in 3D, which is crucial for optimizing texture and overall quality. 
Sustainability is also at the core of our research. We are committed to developing RTE breakfast cereals and puffed snacks in a way that is environmentally friendly, ensuring that the production process focuses largely on plant-based food ingredients. In addition, we attempt to incorporate various by-products, food wastes, and underutilized ingredients into our formulations. This approach not only reduces environmental impact but also supports a more sustainable food system. Our overarching goal is to create RTE breakfast cereals and puffed snacks that are not only delicious and nutritionally balanced but also produced with sustainability in mind, benefiting both consumers and the planet.

With any perturbation to activity or experience, the probability that a neural circuit will undergo plasticity is state-dependent.  For instance, the capacity for plasticity tends to decline with age, lending support to the concept of critical periods.  We develop neural interfaces and control architectures for precisely regulating spiking to create activity states that support plasticity at the cellular, synaptic, and circuit levels.

Amblyopia is a widespread neurodevelopmental visual impairment that arises from maladaptive plasticity during infancy or early childhood.  We aim to develop novel therapeutics for amblyopia that leverage our knowledge of plasticity at different ages and disease severities.  Treatment strategies range from neuroprosthetic implants that directly stimulate the brain to minimally invasive manipulations to visual experience or behavior.
